            Stick-slip friction
    Model of a box being draged along a horizontal plane
    by a spring with constant velocity. The box has 
    stationary friction coefficient mu_s and dynamic
    friction coeff. mu_d. We asume that the spring can
    be modeled by Hook's law. And that the friction force
    is linked to the normal force by R = mu*N
